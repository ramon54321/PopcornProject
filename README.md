## Conduct

 - ESLint is used.

## Technical Theory
### Buy / Sell Rates
Coins are bought and sold from the central coin bank at different rates, depending on the balance of coins. When there are more coins in the bank's posession, the coins are cheaper to buy from the bank. When there are more coins posessed by entites, and the bank is running low, the coins are more expensive to buy, but carry a higher value to return to the bank (Sell). This means the value of the trade is also so to balance the distrabution of coins between the coin bank and the entities.
